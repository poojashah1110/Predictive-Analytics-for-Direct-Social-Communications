# Predictive-Analytics-for-Direct-Social-Communications
The project involved working with a real client - Direct Social Communications, a Belgium based fundraising organisation. In this project, we were provided with data of past several years, the campaigns that were run and donations from recorded donors. We processed the data and split it into training and test sets to make future predictions on which donor would donate in a certain campaign. We trained our data with many algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks to see the performance of each model. We narrowed our feature selection by single-model univariate approach. We estimated the campaign success and cost savings based on our best model. We also did profiling of prospective donors. The final presentation PDF contains all insights derived during the project. The coding is done in Python in Jupyter Notebook.
